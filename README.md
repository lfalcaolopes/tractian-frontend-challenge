## 🔖 About 

This project is a Tree View Application for visualizing and managing industrial assets, organized in a hierarchical structure. The application displays assets, components, and locations in an interactive tree, where each level represents relationships and dependencies. Users can filter the view to find specific components or assets, identify critical sensors, and view paths in the asset hierarchy without losing context. 

## 📌 Ideas to implement 

With more time, some things I would improve on the project include:

- [ ] Text Search Algorithm Optimization
      
- Use text normalization for more efficient comparison to avoid repeated conversions with each search interaction. 
- Use a more efficient pattern-matching algorithm for large strings or more complex searches.

- [ ] Integration of Images in Assets
      
- I noticed that the Figma design included space for asset images, but the provided API did not return this information. With more time, I would add support for images within assets, allowing users to view photos of the equipment directly in the tree structure.

- [ ] Make website fully responsive
